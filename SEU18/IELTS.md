### 多久旅行一次？
*It depends.For example, last year i was preparing for my postgraduating examination, so I didn't go travelling the whole year. But in the vocation right after the examination, I went to Disneyland with my friends. Also, in this summer vocation, I travelled in Japan. So under normal circumstance, I will travel once or twice a year.*
### 旅行的好处有哪些？

What's more, travelling can broaden our horizons. As the saying goes, 'Reading ten thousand books and travelling ten thousand miles'.*

*The most impressive travelling of mine is the travelling me and my friends went to Disneyland. Despite the fact that it's a little bit immature for us to go to an amusment park in our age.

Reading can really make me enjoy my spare time.*
### 喜欢什么类型的书？
